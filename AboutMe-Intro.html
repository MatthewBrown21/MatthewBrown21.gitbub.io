<h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.</p>
<h2>About Me </h2>
<p> My name is Matthew Brown, I am a hardworking student and freelancer. Currently at Clearfiled Highschool, I am taking/have taken multiple technology related classes. Ranging from, computer programming 1, to 3D graphics and Animation using Maya. I have always known that I would focus my future down to technology. I want to be the one who sets up my family's technology in the future, and I want to be the tech wizard my grandparents always call me. I believe that maintaining an education throughout life is very important, but this doesnt mean a formal shcool education. Learning something new is always happening and even creating this webpage using GitHub pages is a very new experience for me. I enjoy the complex problem solving that programming entails, most often, just understanding the problem is the most difficult part of coding, and I intend on making this my strongest asset within the workforce.  </p>
